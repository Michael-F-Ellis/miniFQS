To play the MIDI generated by `abcjs` in a modern web app (using version 6.0+), you generally do **not** need external libraries like `MIDI.js` anymore. The library now has a built-in synthesizer.

However, "generating" the MIDI and "playing" it requires specific internal modules, assets, and browser APIs.

Here are the components you need to assemble for playback to work:

### 1. The Correct Library Import
Standard `abcjs` often includes just the rendering logic. To get audio playback features, you typically need to import the "midi" or "plugin" version, or ensure you are using the full bundle.
*   **If using npm:**
    ```javascript
    import abcjs from "abcjs/midi"; // Includes synth functionality
    ```
*   **If using a script tag:**
    Ensure you are using the `abcjs-basic-min.js` or `abcjs-plugin-min.js` (which usually include the synth), rather than a core-only build if one exists for your specific version.

### 2. Soundfonts (Audio Assets)
The synthesizer needs audio samples (Soundfonts) to produce sound. `abcjs` does not bundle these sound files inside the Javascript file because they are too large.
*   **Requirement:** Your app must be able to fetch these from a URL.
*   **Default:** By default, `abcjs` calls out to a GitHub-hosted URL to fetch these on demand.
*   **Offline/Self-hosted:** If you need your app to work offline or want faster loading, you must download the soundfonts (usually `FluidR3_GM`) and host them in your project's `public/assets` folder, then tell `abcjs` where to find them via the `soundFontUrl` option.

### 3. CSS for Controls (UI Component)
If you use the built-in playback widget (the play/pause button and progress bar), you must include the specific CSS file, or the controls will appear broken or invisible.
*   **File:** `abcjs-audio.css`
*   **Usage:**
    ```javascript
    import "abcjs/abcjs-audio.css";
    ```

### 4. Browser AudioContext (Runtime Requirement)
This is a browser API, not a library, but it is a strictly required "component" of the environment.
*   **The Catch:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, etc.) **block** AudioContext from starting automatically. You generally cannot autoplay music on page load.
*   **Requirement:** You need a user interaction event (like a click) to initialize the playback. `abcjs` handles this if you use their default `SynthController`, but if you build a custom play button, you must resume the `AudioContext` inside a click handler.

### 5. `SynthController` (Logic Component)
While you can programmatically generate a buffer and play it, most web apps use the helper "Controller" provided by `abcjs` to manage the play/pause state and progress bar.
*   **Code Example:**
    ```javascript
    // 1. Render the visual notes
    var visualObj = abcjs.renderAbc("paper", "X:1\nK:D\nDDAA|BBA2|")[0];

    // 2. Initialize the Synth
    var synthControl = new abcjs.synth.SynthController();
    synthControl.load("#audio", null, {
        displayLoop: true,
        displayRestart: true,
        displayPlay: true,
        displayProgress: true,
        displayWarp: true
    });

    // 3. Register the visual object with the synth to preload audio
    var createSynth = new abcjs.synth.CreateSynth();
    createSynth.init({ visualObj: visualObj }).then(function () {
        synthControl.setTune(visualObj, false, {
             // specific audio params (soundfont URL, etc.) go here
        }).then(function (response) {
            console.log("Audio loaded");
        });
    });
    ```

| Component           | Type           | Necessary? | Notes                                                            |
| :------------------ | :------------- | :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **abcjs/midi**      | Library Module | **Yes**    | Use the build that includes synth logic.                         |
| **Soundfonts**      | Assets         | **Yes**    | Fetched remotely by default; can be self-hosted.                 |
| **abcjs-audio.css** | CSS            | **Yes**    | Required if using the default play bar UI.                       |
| **AudioContext**    | Browser API    | **Yes**    | Built into browser, requires user click to start.                |
| **CursorControl**   | Logic          | *Optional* | Required if you want a line moving across the music as it plays. |
