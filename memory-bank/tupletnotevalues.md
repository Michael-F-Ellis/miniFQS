## Tuplet Note Value Rule

The general rule for determining the note value of a tuplet (in simple meter) is to use the note value of the **regular subdivision** that the tuplet replaces.

Specifically, you choose the note value corresponding to the **greatest power of two** (2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) that is **less than** the number of notes in the tuplet.

### How to Apply the Rule
1.  **Identify the Tuplet Number:** Count the number of notes in your tuplet (e.g., 3, 5, 7, 9).
2.  **Find the "Base" Power of Two:** Identify the standard power of two that is closest to, but **lower than**, your tuplet number.
    *   For **3** notes, the base is **2**.
    *   For **5, 6, or 7** notes, the base is **4**.
    *   For **9 through 15** notes, the base is **8**.
3.  **Select the Note Value:** Use the note value that would normally fill the same duration if there were that "Base" number of notes.

### Examples
*   **Triplet (3 notes):**
    *   Lower power of two is **2**.
    *   If the duration is a Quarter Note, 2 notes would be Eighth notes.
    *   *Result:* The triplet is written with **Eighth notes** (3 in the space of 2).

*   **Septuplet (7 notes):**
    *   Lower power of two is **4**.
    *   If the duration is a Quarter Note, 4 notes would be Sixteenth notes.
    *   *Result:* The septuplet is written with **Sixteenth notes** (7 in the space of 4).

*   **Nonuplet (9 notes):**
    *   Lower power of two is **8**.
    *   If the duration is a Quarter Note, 8 notes would be Thirty-second notes.
    *   *Result:* The nonuplet is written with **Thirty-second notes** (9 in the space of 8).

### Exceptions and Nuance
*   **Compound Meters:** In compound meters (like 6/8), tuplets often follow the beat unit (dotted quarter) rather than a power of two. For example, a "duplet" (2 notes) in 6/8 takes the space of 3 eighth notes, so it is written as eighth notes (2 in the space of 3).
*   **Alternative Notation:** While the rule above (contracting ratio) is the standard modern convention, some older or specific notation styles might use the "expanding" ratio (e.g., writing a septuplet as thirty-second notes, implying 7 in the space of 8). However, the rule of "closest lower power of two" is the widely accepted standard for clarity.
